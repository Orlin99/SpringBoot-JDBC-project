# SpringBoot JDBC project

## The Idea:
This is an Application ment to help people achieve their fitness goals based on personal preferences
in exercises and food. The information this App is planned to provide is to educate the user about 
physical exercises with free weights, body weight and some cardio exercises. Other than the App
provides the client with an additional information about different kinds of foods like general macros
and more secondary stuff. The app only requieres the user to put information about himeself or herself
and future function will be based on those parameters (given by the user) to calculate the calories he
has to consume every day so he, or she would be able achieve their goals. Other bonuses of the application
will provide the user are that the user can track hi progression over It's journey. Benefit of this app are
that the user will be able so see exercises along with foods which other fitness applications don't combine.
Cons are that the app is very far away from it's final destination and there are a lot of things, functions
to be added and one of them is the Front end. But for now the App has these technical features.
